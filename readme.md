## Description ##

Automatically display another product in place of an out-of-stock product.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does this plugin overwrite my product data when it goes out-of-stock? ###
No. This plugin does not alter your out-of-stock products in any way.

It simply puts a veneer on your out-of-stock items with items that are in stock so users are presented with something they can purchase immediately.

### What happens if the fallback product is also out-of-stock? ###
This is why you can add more than one fallback, in order of priority, so that if your first choice fallback is sold out, another fallback will be used.

If all of the fallbacks are out-of-stock, no replacement will be made to the original product.

### Do fallbacks work on products placed in widget areas or cross-sell locations too? ###
Yes! Everywhere your product is being displayed on the site, whether in a widget area, or as a cross-selling or up-selling item, will be replaced by its fallback when it goes out-of-stock.

### What will happen when someone visits the URL of a product that is out-of-stock? ###
If that produce has an available fallback the user will be redirected to that automatically.

If no fallback is available, no redirection will occur.
